# Distributed-Systems-Project

# Summary

- This is my Distributed Systems Project from DS and DB Subjects at University of Coimbra, where we have created a Tier 3 concurrent Application with Multi-Threaded Back-End servers, all written in Java, along with an MVC APP(Struts2) and a non-GUI Java Client. To save the data and keep it coherent we have used a Relational DBMS(PostgreSQL). We also used SOAP(XML Configs) and REST Web Services(Facebook Login).


<h1> Project Description </h1>
- In this Project, we created a small Auction for Ideas where users could buy tokens called DEI coins and bid on Ideas of other users. They also could create new Ideas, binding them in Topics, for auction where each Idea had a starting price, time for auction, buyout price (was also available if the user wanted), the idea description alongside with other info.
- The user could create a new account in the system by filling up a form or he could use his Facebook account to log in on our system.
- Multiple Users could log in on the system and access the same Idea at the same time.
- Users could also comment on the Ideas or relate them with other Ideas if they were found interesting.
