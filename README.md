# Distributed-Systems-Project

# Summary

- This is my Distributed Systems Project from DS Subject at University of Coimbra where we have created a Tier 3 Application with back end servers, all written in Java, along with an MVC APP(Struts2) and a DBMS(PostgreSQL) to save our data. We also used SOAP and REST Web Services.


<h1> Project Description </h1>
- In this Project, we created a small Auction for Ideas where users could buy tokens called DEI coins and bid on Ideas of other users.
